This program acts as an agenda to store names, birthdays, relations, mails, etc... 
It can also calculate dates and ages, as well as searching through the agenda, counting lines, copying specific lines, opening the agenda file, searching and copying emails or even open gmail for easy access.
It has support for a config file, where you can change the mail provider used by the user.
There is an extra program to remind the user of birthdays, which need to be selected from the main program.
To run the birthdays program automatically you need to add it to autorun, and to make the console invisible you need to use the .pyw version.
